As of now; I will be working on a Dataset of multiple variables; ranging from weather at the moment of accident untill the categorical value of day of the week and month of the year.
Is there different behavior in the weekends or on friday? What is the impact if seasonalality?

This document will be updated as soon as first analysis of data have been done. (as of now no idea if the relevancy of all data)
