Introduction

The amount of accidents with mild/serious consequences with cars involved is rising in the world.
This due to the increase in world population as well as overall increase of wealth.
Although driver's permits/licenses are required to drive a car; in certain cases based on weather conditions, extra attention is required based on the region and weather.
This algorithm will predict what the changes are of accidents (and the graviety of the accident), based on certain parameters.
